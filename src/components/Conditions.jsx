                            features may also be limited based on where you are
                            located and what we know about you. Aphia acts as
                            the service provider of the merchant in connection
                            with the Aphia service, except in cases where
                            another payment service provider enables a merchant
                            to accept the Aphia service. We may use the services
                            of one or more third parties, affiliates,
                            processors, and/or financial institutions to provide
                            the Aphia service. Your payment service provider is
                            the entity that issued your payment method e.g.
                            credit card, debit card or mobile money provider.
                            Except for our limited role in enabling the merchant
                            to accept the Aphia service, we are not involved in
                            any underlying sales transaction between you and the
                            merchant. In particular: we are neither the buyer
                            nor the seller of the items or services the merchant
                            offers for sale and are not a party to the sales
                            contract; the merchant is the seller of record for
                            all sales via the Aphia service. The name of Aphia,
                            one of our affiliates, or the merchant’s payment
                            service provider, will appear on the statement
                            issued by your payment service provider (which may
                            also, at our option, display the merchant’s trade or
                            business name). A buyer’s obligation to pay for an
                            item purchased via the Aphia service is satisfied
                            when the buyer properly pays in full for that item
                            via the Aphia service. We are not a fiduciary or
                            trustee of either the buyer or the merchant. Subject
                            to section 8 below, we will not mediate disputes
                            between buyers and merchants or enforce or execute
                            the performance of any sales contract.

                            shall be denominated in the currency stated on the

                            currency sub-unit, we may round up the transaction
                            value to the nearest sub-unit. You may be charged a
                            cash advance, currency exchange (if applicable) or
                            other fees directly by your payment service
